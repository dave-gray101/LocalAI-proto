# LocalAI Protobuf Definitions

This repository exists to support [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI). gRPC is used to connect individual backends to the primary service. Currently, this is versioned and built within the main repo. This repository will eventually simplify externally-built backends, but currently is experimental.

This repo will also be used to experiment with breaking changes to the protocol, as this is a good opportunity to consider refactoring our gRPC layer.
